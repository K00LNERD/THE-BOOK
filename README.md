# THE-BOOK
the hackathon project for hack off 3.0

IDEA - Ebooks are cheap and portable, you can take your device with you anywhere with a whole library in it, but still ebooks are not preffered over physical books by most of the booklovers they just don't give the book reading experience which a physical book provides, So what if we give the immersive book reading experience of physical book with the cost effectiveness and portability. 

we have done exactly that though we have just proved the concept here but the results are promissing, 


EXECUTION- we used vuforia and unity engine to create Vumarks which are essentially customised QR codes, we first took a photo of the cover page of a book and used it to track the movements of the book ad successfully presented a cover page of a different book. To check wether the tracking and overlaying actually gives the immersive results and the result is infront of you then we took the Vumarks and wrote a C# script to map different vumark to different pages of a book which is shown in the next patrt of the video and it is also working, it is showing different pages on different  vumarks, now we just need to make a ui of the app and use sdk to make it compatible to differnt AR glasses in the market or glases which are about to get launched, like JIO glasses, oppo glasses, hololense, apple glasses(2022) and several others. with those glasses and a just one book filled with only our vumarks on every pages we can finally bring the pros of ebooks and physical books together withou their cons

Business side - we are ready with the revenue model too, we think of a subscription based model with credits like the one audible use.

The first part of the video shows how the tracking and recognition is going to look in the final product, the second part shows how with help of Vumarks( a type of QR code) we can map which page of the ebook to show on which page of the physical book, every vu mark is different and through that our app is mapping the page of the Ebook, we can use these same vumarks which will be printed on book to map different books
